- Why? You can find the answer in below sections (I hope 🤐) 

## Little bit anatomy
- You can find my **contractAddress** and **contractABI** at *public/module.js*
- If you interest to replace my contract address with your own, don't forget to compile it with ==npx webpack==
- To looks all transaction on my **contractAddress** jump into [it](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x78ca25ea6c99366772be3a9869b12b0e7ace5409)
- At that link, you can see my contract source code 🤫
- More than this, you can see the currently active quote or note and can change it (But, don't write strange things 😒)
